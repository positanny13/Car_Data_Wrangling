  The car dataset contains information about various automobiles, including attributes such as price, engine size, horsepower, fuel efficiency, dimensions, and other technical specifications.
However, like most real-world datasets, it contains missing values, inconsistent data formats, and variables that require transformation before meaningful analysis or modeling can be performed.

The objective of this project is to perform comprehensive data preprocessing to improve the dataset’s quality, consistency, and usability. This involves identifying and handling missing values, correcting data types, standardizing and normalizing numerical variables, and transforming data into suitable formats for analysis.
Specifically, the preprocessing tasks include identifying missing values and applying appropriate techniques to handle them, correcting incorrect data formats to ensure numerical and categorical variables are properly represented, standardizing units and formats for consistency, and normalizing numerical features through centering and scaling to ensure comparability. Additionally, binning will be applied to convert continuous variables into categorical groups for easier interpretation, and indicator variables will be created to represent categorical features in a numerical format suitable for analysis and machine learning models.

By performing these preprocessing steps, the dataset will be transformed into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready format, enabling accurate statistical analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.
